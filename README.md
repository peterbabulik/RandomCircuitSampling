# Random Circuit Sampling (RCS) Technical Documentation

## Overview

Random Circuit Sampling (RCS) is a quantum computing benchmark that helps evaluate the performance and capabilities of quantum processors. It involves generating random quantum circuits and comparing the output distributions between quantum and classical computers.

## Technical Details

### Circuit Generation Process

1. **Circuit Structure**
   - Composed of alternating layers of single-qubit and two-qubit gates
   - Circuit depth determines the number of layers
   - Gates are selected randomly from predefined sets

2. **Gate Sets**
   
   Single-Qubit Gates:
   - Pauli Gates: X, Y, Z
   - Hadamard Gate (H)
   - T Gate
   - Rotation Gates: Rx(θ), Ry(θ), Rz(θ)

   Two-Qubit Gates:
   - CNOT (Controlled-NOT)
   - ISWAP (Interaction SWAP)

3. **Circuit Parameters**
   - Number of qubits (n)
